        <h2>First project:
           <hr style="width:10%;text-align:right;margin-left:0px;margin-top: 0px;">
            <p>The first project consists of an idea developed by Bruno for the FUNKO Company. It is the implementation of a system where the Funkos that are bought not only out of the app but also from other sources such as comic book conventions, unofficial stores or even a gift can be registred in the users account.</p>

                <img src="funko2.png">
            </div>
            <p>It was made using PhP, local data base, a little bit of HTML and CSS as well.</p>

        <h3>Second project:
            <hr style="width:10%;text-align:right;margin-left:0px;margin-top: 0px;">
            <p>The second project was made in order to detect cyberattacks by using differents data structures. One way of detecting cyber attacks is through the collection of all the pertinent information that allows us to perform optimized searches for the timely detection of malicious access through robot networks. And having this we built the following solution:
                <div class="cyber">
                <img src="test.png">
                <img src="cyber1.png">
                <img src="cyber2.png">
            </div>
            <p>This project took a lot of time to be developed, was one of the first contacts that I have had with the language.</p>
